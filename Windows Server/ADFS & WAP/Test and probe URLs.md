# ADFS Urls
- https://localhost/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm (what I usually use for a health check)
- https://localhost/adfs/fs/federationserverservice.asmx
- https://localhost/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
- https://localhost/fs/probe (althought I've had trouble getting that to work)

To see more, open AD FS Management, go to **Service** and then **Endpoints**. Every row with a **Yes** under enabled should be available

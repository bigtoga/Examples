## Digital imperative: moving faster than ever before
**It's business unusual for all of our customers**

Many hidden opportunities in current crisis - Things are now suddenly very different, and one key thing is that people are much more willing to try something new. 

With more WFH, no more "swivel chair IT" - where developers can turn around, ask for something, and IT delivers. Now we need more self-service software. 

**Anything that can run remotely should be ready to run remotely** - this drastically elevates the value of IT

## Key change: "Everyone, all at once"
IT cannot keep up with all the requests - used to be able to prioritize, but now every department is overwhelming IT with requests all at once.
* Find a way to provide self tools that allow people to "do more on their own" without fear of "making a mess" or "making a mistake"
* IT should focus more on enablement rather than delivery
* Need to give people sandbox
* Measure reactive work - try to limit to 20%
* Expecting 30% of workforce to still be remote
* 2021: half your estimated projects and focus more on proactive enablement projects

## Lindsey Irvine - Chief Marketing Officer
3 main themes:
1. Responsive: how do I quickly unlock data and integrate data?
   - Healthcare: virtual care
   - Retail: surge in retail orders
   - Pharma: COVID-19 testing
   - All of these are critical, and require data across the org. 
1. How can we increase speed and agility?
1. What investments do I make to set my team and business up for success and growth?

### Integration is the #1 reason new initiatives fail
1. Legacy infrastructure
1. Siloed data
1. Disconnected customer experiences
1. Inaccurate data
1. Multiple clouds
* Compliance FDPR & CCPA

* Custom code is the enemy of speed. It creates a bottleneck because only 1-2 people know it
* IT spends 80% of its time "integrating" instead of "innovating"
   - Integrating 150 apps takes a LOT of manpower, time

## Amit A. from Mars Corp
New CEO - wanted to move to cloud, have Digital Transformation. 
* We started to see huge explosions in "cloud applications"
* This was great at first but became a huge issue later
* Trying to get the various cloud applications to "talk to each other" was massive problem
* We decided on Mulesoft and decided to completely re-architect entire software architecture of
our entire org. 
* After going through that hard, long, arduous process, today we have 350+ applications across the business
and are able to launch 50-60 new apps per year

## Lindsey - Agility, Speed and Efficiency
* 60% speed improvement
* 65% increase in developer productivity
* 63% reduction in maintenance

## Anypoint Platform
Does 3 things:
1. Unlock, unify, and secure data
1. Ensure business continuity - scale to meet surge in digital demand and solve operational gaps
1. Transform to increase speed, agility

## SVP
Guidance from Mulesoft - accelerate your time-to-value:
Go fast immediately, accelerate thereafter with:
1. Global Marketplace - connectors
2. Developer Productivity - accelerators, tutorials & docs, knowledge hub
3. Expert community

### Building blocks, not systems
Systems slow you down and are only "usable by few". To make them "usable by all", use Mulesoft. Composable, connected digital building blocks

The more black boxes you have, the harder future innovation is due to rigidity.

# Favorite ways to explain 
Moez Ali, author of PyCaret, has maybe [my favorite analogy](https://link.medium.com/uet9UjNU56):
> What is the difference between a docker image and a docker container? ... think about a docker image as a mold based on which container is created. An image is essentially a snapshot of container
> Docker images become containers at runtime when they run on a Docker Engine
> At the end of the day, docker is just a file with a few lines of instructions that are saved under your project folder with the name “Dockerfile”
> **Another way to think about docker file is that they are like recipes you have invented in your own kitchen. When you share those recipes with somebody else and they follow the exact same instructions, they are able to produce the same dish. Similarly, you can share your docker file with other people, who can then create images and run containers based on that docker file.**

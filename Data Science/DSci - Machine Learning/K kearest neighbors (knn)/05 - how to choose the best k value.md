Step 1: Use the cookie cutter code below to plot the k values across your test dataset 
and your training data set

Step 2: Find the first instance (aka left-most) where the "Testing accuracy Score" of 
the test dataset (orange line) and the training dataset (blue) are the closest. This is 
the "1" circle in the graphic

Step 3: If this is the start of a fairly stable line (aka the line continues along the 
same y axis values to the right), choose the x axis value of the *next* plotted data point
(circle 2 in the graphic = "15")

### Other things to consider
Note that if k={same as the number of data points}, then the current data point being evaluated will be
classified as "whatever the class of the majority is" (i.e. it's a popularity algorithim at that point)

Some people like k={square_root_of_the_number_of_data_points} also

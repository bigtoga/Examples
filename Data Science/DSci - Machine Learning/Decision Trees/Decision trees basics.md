Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised machine learning model used for classification and regression. 
This model learns in a **hierarchical fashion** by repeatedly splitting the chosen dataset into separate branches
to learn non-linear relationships. **Random Forest** is a supervised machine learning model that averages the 
result of any chosen number of Decision Trees using randomly selected observations and selected column features. 
The result is a final average of all values predicted by all present trees in the Random Forest.

**Supervised ML** - we know the outcome, and we provide it to "the machine" as labeled training data.  The machine then generates a prediction, compares it to the actual result, and calculates error rate. It then uses this to learn how to "do better next time".

* Classification - applying labels to data. **spam email filtering** is classification
* Regression - fitting data to predict where a new data point lies

**Unsupervised ML** - we don't know the outcome
* Clustering - finding groups within a population; used for recommender systems, targeted marketing, customer segmentation
* Dimensionality Reduction is critical

**Reinforcement ML** - you set up a reward system for a sequence of events, and the computer optimizes to get the reward
* Drones - people know that drones could work, but they kept trying to program them to "be level". Eventually someone 
figured out a way to set up a reward system that allowed the computer to try to game the system, the drone itself was figuring out the balance

![Accuracy vs. Precision](https://i.imgur.com/7RhrfYY.png)

Accuracy:
- Can be judged with "one arrow" 
    - You have a target - an archery target that has three rings, each specifying multiple degrees of "correctness" for your target (i.e. center ring is "the most correct" and "outer ring" would be "the least correct")
    - "Where the arrow stuck" is the measurement and, the more "correct" the placement, the higher the accuracy 
    - If you fire multiple arrows, each arrow is **individually judged** based on how accurate the arrow's placement is relative to the target (vs. how accurate the arrow is relative to previously fired arrows)
    - 10 arrows = 10 different accuracy scores

Precision:
- Can only be judged with "multiple arrows"; a single arrow is only a measure of accuracy
- Each arrow is judged relative to how close it is relative to the other arrows (vs. how *accurate* it is)

Accuracy = "How close this single arrow came to the 'most correct' target" and Precision = "How close each of the arrows were to each other"

The best is High Accuracy and High Precision

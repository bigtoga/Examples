# Predicting Customer Churn

Companies leverage machine learning to identify patterns in huge volumes of historical, demographic and sales data to identify and understand why a company loses customers. The company can then utilize machine learning capabilities to analyze behaviors among existing customers to alert it to which customers are at risk of taking their business elsewhere, identify the reasons why those customers are leaving and then determine what steps the company should take to retain them.

Churn is a KPI in all businesses but in particular service and subscription-based businesses. 
- Media companies (NYT, USA Today, HBO, Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, Spotify, etc)
- CRM systems like Salesforce, Siebel, etc
- Accounting packages
- HR packages 
- Telecom

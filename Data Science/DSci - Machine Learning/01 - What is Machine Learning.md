# Andrew Ng's definition
From his Standard Machine Learning course:
> Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
> Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers
- E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
- T = the task of playing checkers
- P = the probability that the program will win the next game

Bayesian spam filtering is based on `Bayes rule`, a statistical theorem that gives you the probability of an event. 
In Bayesian filtering it is used to give you the probability that a certain email is spam.

Named after the statistician Rev. **Thomas Bayes** who provided an equation that basically allows new information 
to update the outcome of a probability calculation. The rule is also called the Bayes-Price rule after 
the mathematician Richard Price, as he recognized the importance of the theorem, made some corrections 
to Bayesâ€™ work and put the rule to use.

When dealing with spam **Bayes theorem is used to calculate a probability whether a certain message is spam 
based on words in the title and message, learning from messages that were identified as spam and messages 
that were identified as not being spam (sometimes called ham)**.

### False positives
The objective of the learning ability is to reduce the number of false positives. 

> Baye's Theorem combines the probability of a hypothesis (the "prior") with the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis and the base rate of the cause to get the posterior probability, or probability of the hypothesis given the data.

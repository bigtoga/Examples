# Questions
**Hot path / cold path in the MDAP example**

**Azure Notebooks?**
 
**How do we get plugged in to receive notifications from the Azure Black Belt team in the future (for trainings, webinars, etc)?**
 
**At what point do teams decide it's worth it to try Synapse? What's the expected learning curve?** 
 
**Can I use Terraform w Azure ML? Azure Data Factory?** 

**List of best practices for ADF?**

**You are working on the master branch - can we require topic/feature branches for ADF?**
- I assume that's simply set w Branch policies and Branch security settings

**Downloadable version of ADF?**
- No

**Is ADF integrated w Azure Data Studio?**
- 

**Even if ADF is created w GUI, as long as we sync it to a Git repo, it still stores source control history?**

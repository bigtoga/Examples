- Barton Paulson's defition is "An amount of data that is so large that it cannot be processed by a single computer. Analysis of big data can reveal important insights and trends not possible with smaller sample sets."

   - "I want to show up to the second customer statistics across 5 measures" - uhhhh, sorry, that takes about 3 days to generate right now...

## Sets in Tableau
A Set in Tableau is simply a subset of dimensional members
* Dimension "Year"
* Data: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020
* A `Set` of the dimension: 2014, 2017, 2020

You can now agg / view those items in the set

## In and Out

In and Out can break out every dimension and tell you whether the measure is In the set or Out of the set. It's a way to (a) show every dimension member even if they are not in the set, and then (b) tell you whether that dimensional member is "in" or "out" of a target Set.

1. In the Dimensions window, find the dimension you want
2. Right click on it and choose to create a new * set *
3. Select the dimension members you want included in this set

## Conditional Sets
Conditional sets allow you to create conditions for inclusion in the Set rather than you choosing the dimensional members by hand

## Combined Sets
You can combine sets!

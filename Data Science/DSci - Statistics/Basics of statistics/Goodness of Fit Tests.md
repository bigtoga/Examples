# Goodness of Fit
Shows you if the sample data fits a distribution from a certain population (i.e. a population with a normal distribution or one with a Weibull distribution). In other words, it tells you if your sample data represents the data you would expect to find in the actual population. Goodness of fit tests commonly used in statistics are:

* [Chi-square test](https://github.com/bigtoga/Examples/blob/master/Statistics/Basics%20of%20statistics/Chi%20square%20tests.md) - most commonly used
* Kolmogorov-Smirnov
* Anderson-Darling
* Shipiro-Wilk

**Bayes probability** is a data analysis technique that uses prior probabilities and test
information to create posterior (after the fact) probabilities

Named after the statistician Rev. Thomas Bayes who provided an equation that basically allows new information to update the outcome of a probability calculation. The rule is also called the Bayes-Price rule after the mathematician Richard Price, as he recognized the importance of the theorem, made some corrections to Bayes’ work and put the rule to use.

# Naive Bayes classifiers
**Naive Bayes** is a specific type of machine learning classification that
predicts but ignores the relationships between the predictor variables themselves. [Read this article for more](https://link.medium.com/wCxsUSzZ56) on using Naive Bayes to predict in ML

## The three types of Naive Bayes classification problems
1. Multinomial - assumes the data follows a multinomial distribution. It is mainly used in **document classification problems** and looks at things like term frequency / frequency of words
2. Bernoulli - used when predictors are Boolean 
3. Gaussian - used when predictors are continuous over a Gaussian distribution (bell curve a.k.a. normal distribution)

Quotes from that article:
 
> In order to understand Naive Bayes and get as much value out of this article, it’s expected that you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
- **Conditional Probability**: probability of event “A” occurring while another event is occurring at the same time. Example would be, “What is the probability that it will rain given that it is cloudy?”
- **Joint probability**: calculates the probability of two events happening at the same time 
- **Proportionality**: refers to the relationship between two quantities that are multiplicatively connected to a constant, or in simpler terms, whether their ratio yields a constant
- **Bayes’ Theorem**: describes the probability of an event (posterior) based on the prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event

Two types of chi-square tests and both use the chi-square statistic and distribution for different purposes:

## Chi-square goodness of fit test 
Determines if a sample data matches a population. This is one of several options for a "Goodness of Fit Test"

## Chi-square test for independence 
Compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.

## Interpreting the results
A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well (a.k.a. there is a relationship)

A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well (e.g. no relationship)

Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the `linear relationship` between two (Simple Linear Regression or SLR) 
or more (Multiple Linear Regression or MLR) variables — a dependent variable and independent variable(s). 
* Independent variables: Data that can be controlled directly
* Dependent variables: Data that cannot be controlled directly

**Linear** implies the following: arranged in or extending along a straight or nearly straight line. Linear suggests that the relationship between dependent and independent variable can be expressed in a straight line. Remember the equation for a line?
~~~
y = mx + c
~~~
Linear regression is based on this equation where
* y is the dependent variable i.e. the variable that needs to be estimated and predicted.
* x is the independent variable i.e. the variable that is controllable. It is the input.
* m is the slope. It determines what will be the angle of the line. It is the parameter denoted as β.
* c is the intercept. A constant that determines the value of y when x is 0.


* `Linear relationship` basically means that when one (or more) independent variables increases (or decreases), 
the dependent variable increases (or decreases) in tandem.
* The factor that is being predicted (the factor that the equation *solves for*) is called the dependent variable. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables.
* [Simple linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) typically uses OLS ([Ordinary Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares)

SLR models also include the errors in the data (also known as *residuals*). Residuals are basically the differences between the true value of Y and the predicted/estimated value of Y. 

The relationship between variables "Y" and "X" is represented by this equation: ![x](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/968be557dd22b1a2e536b8d22369cfdb37f58703)
* X is the independent variable — the variable we are using to make predictions
* Y is the dependent variable (the variable we are trying to predict)
* m is the slope of the regression line — it represent the effect X has on Y. In other words, if X increases by 1 unit, Y will increase by exactly m units. 
* b is a constant, also known as the Y-intercept. If X equals 0, Y would be equal to b . This is not necessarily applicable in real life

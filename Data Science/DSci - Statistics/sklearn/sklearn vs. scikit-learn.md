~~~ he package "scikit-learn" is recommended to be installed using pip install scikit-learn but in your code imported using import sklearn.

A bit confusing, because you can also do pip install sklearn and will end up with the same scikit-learn package installed, 
because there is a "dummy" pypi package sklearn which will install scikit-learn for you.

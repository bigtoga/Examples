**Dependent variable** (a.k.a. response variable, y-variable, or output variable) is "the thing you want to measure"
* Cancer cell growth
* Height

**Independent variables** (a.k.a. x-variables, predictor variables) are "the factors you think might have an influence on the dependent variable". Use then to *explain* the reaponse variable's change in value. 
* Amount of sugar intake
* Number of chemotherapy sessions taken
* Age

Example of a plant growth study: 
* **What are you wanting to learn?** "Which factors influence plant growth the most?"
* **What is your dependent variable?** "Plant growth during the study in inches"
* **What factors do you want to use to see whether they have any impact?** "We will measure daily the amount of fertilizer applied, the soil moisture, and the amount of sunlight"
* **What is the y value of your plot?** The dependent variable, `plant_growth`
* **What are the x values of your plot?** The independent variables: `fertilizer_10g_per_day`, `soil_mosture_50pct`, `sunlight_16hrs`

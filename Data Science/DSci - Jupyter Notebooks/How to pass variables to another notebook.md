Use python's magic commands - 
```python 
%pwd #print the current working directory

%cd #change working directory

%ls #show contents in the current directory

# load code into the Jupyter notebook
%load [insert Python filename here] 

# Pass variables between Jupyter Notebooks
%store [insert variable here] 

# Run another notebook - can put inside an if() also
%run ./called_notebook.ipynb

# List all variables
%who 

# List all 'int' variables
%who int

# List all magic commands
%lsmagic #show all magic commands
```

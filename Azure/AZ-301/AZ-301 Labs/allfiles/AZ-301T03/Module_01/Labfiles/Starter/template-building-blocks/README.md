# Azure Building Blocks: Simplifying Resource Deployment


![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mspnp/template-building-blocks.svg?branch=master) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@mspnp/azure-building-blocks.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mspnp/azure-building-blocks)

> __Important Note__: Version 2.1.1 of Azure Building Blocks introduced breaking changes to versions earlier than 2.0.4. Versions earlier than 2.0.4 will no longer function. Please upgrade to version 2.0.4 or greater to continue using Azure Building Blocks. 

The Azure Building Blocks project is a command line tool and set of Azure Resource Manager templates designed to simplify deployment of Azure resources. Users author a set of simplified parameters to specify settings for Azure resources, and the command line tool merges these parameters with best practice defaults to produce a set of final parameter files that can be deployed with the Azure Resource Manager templates.

# Getting Started

Install the Azure Building Blocks using npm:

```
npm install -g @mspnp/azure-building-blocks
```

Verify the version of azure building blocks you are running using the command below. Make sure you are running version 2.0.4 or later.

```
azbb -V
```

Then, [author an Azure Building Blocks parameter file](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki/create-a-template-building-blocks-parameter-file) and [run the `azbb` command line tool](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki/command-line-reference).

# Documentation

Full documentation for the command line tool and parameter file schema is available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki).

# Examples

Azure Building Blocks parameters to deploy three identical VMs:

```json
"type": "VirtualMachine",
"settings": {
    "vmCount": 3,
    "osType": "windows",
    "namePrefix": "test",
    "adminPassword": "testPassw0rd!23",
    "nics": [{"subnetName": "web"}],
    "virtualNetwork": {"name": "ra-vnet"}
}
```

The command line tool merges best practice defaults to the parameters as follows:

-	Enables diagnostics on all VMs
-	Deploys the VMs in an availability set 
-	All VM disks are managed
-	OS is latest Windows Server 2016 image
-	Public IP created for each VM

To add a scaleset with three identical VMs:

```json
"type": "VirtualMachine",
"settings": {
    "vmCount": 3,
    "osType": "windows",
    "namePrefix": "test",
    "adminPassword": "testPassw0rd!23",
    "nics": [{
        "subnetName": "web",
        "isPublic": false
        }],
    "virtualNetwork": {"name": "ra-vnet"},
    "scaleSetSettings": { }
}
```

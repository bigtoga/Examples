   <summary>Azure: Invent with Purpose with Scott Guthrie</summary>

## Azure Kubernetes
* ak8s now "enterprise grade" according to MSFT
* General Availability of Container Services

## Cosmos DB
* Free tier announced - 1st 400 RUs of throughput and x GB free
* Serverless pricing
* Auto-scale to maintain single digit ms
* **Capable of trillions of events per second**
> Microsoft is also announcing the forthcoming general availability of **Azure Cosmos DB autoscale** provisioned throughput (previously called autopilot), which offers SLA-backed single-digit millisecond latency and 99.999% availability guaranteed while taking the planning and management of throughput capacity off customers’ hands, making it well-suited for large, unpredictable workloads.

## Azure Cognitive Services
* Vision, Speech, Search, Language, Decision
* Pre-built models you can use with zero knowledge of ML
* Enhanced container support
* "Personalizer" is the only AI unsupervised model
* "Personalizer Apprentice" is a new mode

## Power Platform
* Allows developers to blend Microsoft 365 + Dynamics 365 + Azure

## Power Apps - low/no code tool for "citizen developers"
https://github.com/jeffhollan

Demo: Power App in Teams -> API Mgmt servioce -> Azure k8s -> Azure Cosmos DB. Showed an app on mobile 
* Cosmos DB
* VS2019 - connected to Cosmos DB
   - Add a dependency --> Cosmos DB and VS2019 brings in connections
   - VS2019 gives you GUI option to use Azure Key Vault so you never ever need to see a pssword
   - Cosmos DB SDK installed
* New tool: **HttpRepl** - allows you to browse and work with your local API development using command line
   - ls - lists the endpoints
   - get - runs a get
   - [download HttpRepl](https://github.com/dotnet/HttpRepl)
* Deploy API to Azure Kubernetes Services
* Configure API Management to serve
* Launch Power Apps and build your tool
* Publish to Microsoft Teams
   - You can instantly add any Power App to Teams

What they are calling Azure Synapse + Azure ML + PowerBI

# NEW: Azure Synapse Link
Links your existing **Cosmos DB** operational databases to Synapse automatically - "in mere seconds" - and without any code.
* No ETL needed
* Real time data analytics
* No performance impact on the database

"Will add to other relational databases in the future"

### How it works
Single click inside the Cosmos DB portal enables it. Holy moly. This is absolutely a game changer

   <summary>Fairness in Machine Learning</summary>
   
# Fairlearn - new open source toolkit from Microsoft
[Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) - 
* Integrated within Azure Machine Learning in future
* Helps determine "Is my model fair?"
* Helps teams mitigate fairness issues

Input: Sensitive attribute, Performance Metric

From github page:
> An AI system can behave unfairly for a variety of reasons. In Fairlearn, we define whether an AI system is behaving unfairly in terms of its impact on people – i.e., in terms of harms. We focus on two kinds of harms:
* *Allocation harms*. These harms can occur when AI systems extend or withhold opportunities, resources, or information. Some of the key applications are in hiring, school admissions, and lending.
*Quality-of-service harms*. Quality of service refers to whether a system works as well for one person as it does for another, even if no opportunities, resources, or information are extended or withheld.
>We follow the approach known as *group fairness*, which asks: Which groups of individuals are at risk for experiencing harms? The relevant groups need to be specified by the data scientist and are application specific.

## Interpretability techniques

## InterpretML
Microsoft has open sourced [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret) - blackbox and glassbox modes, Interpret-text tools
* Glass box models - models that are designed to be inherently interpretable. Lossless explainability
   - Decision trees
* Black box models - I can't inspect it, nor can I explain how it works. Approximate explainability - shap, lime, partial dependence, sensitivity analysis

## Fairness Mitigation

Select `Fairness Criteria` - Democratic Partiy or Equalized Odds?
Then Select `Mitigation`

   <summary>Ask the Team: Azure App Service Team</summary>
Chris Lauren

Sabina Cartacio 
## When do you update the App Service .NET Framework or .NET Core such that it affects everyone?
Security reasons only, and even those are announced

## Is there a plan for TLS 1.3 in App Service?

## Any plans for Azure private DNS via App Services?
Yes, but... has to work with Private Link first. Expecting it before Ignite though

## Will App Services eventually run on GPUs?
Maybe but that's pretty exotic so long time away if ever

## How do the new healthchecks in Azure App Service work?
Healthchecks are about to go GA but Lots of issues related to ping times. 

## How to prevent access to an app that's not fully warmed up?
Azure App Service can ping both (a) a path, and (b) an expected HTTP STATUS CODE.
During your warm up, just have that return 404/500. Only once the warm up is done
should your app return 200

## Does App Service Plan support udp?
No, http and http/2

## Will App Service support containers?   
Yes, but it is not App Service's intent to be a container registry but we want to help 

## Have a mix of MVC+ASP.NET Core virt. apps in IIS exposed via Web Forms website. How to plan migration to App Service?


# Can an App Service deliver good performance for web applications which are heavily dependent on DB and Storage interactions? Are there any limitations to consider in this regard?
Yes, suggest you use connection pooling heavily.

Moderator: Azure Private Endpoints will be in Preview in a few weeks that will allow App Services direct access to your Azure VM-based services

## News about App Service Managed Certificates coming to GA? I'd really like to get some of those in production use. Also what are the plans on naked domain support?
No news, but working on it. Maybe 2 months

## Can App Service container logs be routed to Azure App Insights?
No, but maybe we could look to do that (i.e. the underlying Docker logs)

   <summary>Train and deploy ML models at scale using Azure Machine Learning</summary>
   Azure VMs in preview with PyTorch/etc pre-installed and configured
   
# Azure Machine Learning
**Datasets**, **Experiments** are projects, the "groupings" of all the attempts to create the model, **Pipelines**, **Models**

Suggestion: 
1. Use AutoML to do the base/initial feature importance and to identify hyperoptimization pararmeters

## Questions
How can we control costs relative to Azure compute for data scientists? RBAC

When to use Hyperdrive vs. hyperoptimization? Think of them as being on a continuum - hyperoptimization is running in the backend constantly testing all the modelling algorithms whereas hyperdrive is just doing the ones you want

URLs to the notebook? https://github.com/microsoft/bert-stack-overflow/blob/master/1-Training/AzureServiceClassifier_Training.ipynb

What python libraries can we use with AML? Any including tensorflow

Does AML use Linux or Windows? Linux

Cn automated AML prevent overfitting? Automated ML has guardrails to warn you of overfitting, but in general Azure ML does not take care of this for you.

Can you export automated AML to python code so we could explore? Yes, can download as a pickle file

ML Ops - can we code our model and then deploy automatically? Yes, AML integrates w Azure DevOps such that, when you register the model in the **Model Registry**, that can automatically kick off a release pipeline that validates / tests the model (maybe in Container instance) and then rolls out the model to an Azure Kubernetes cluster.

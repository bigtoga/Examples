   <summary>Infrastructure as code - build Azure applications with ARM templates
</summary>
Neil Peterson - https://github.com/neilpeterson, author of [ARM Templates extension for VS Code](https://github.com/neilpeterson/vscode-azurearmtools)

> Description: Get best practices for deploying/maintaining infrastructure with ARM templatesâ€“includes template authoring tooling 
enhancements, What-IF, Azure Blueprints, Azure DevOps integrations and investments in the deployment platform.

## What-if? 
The `-c` parameter is shortcut for `confirm-with-what-if` and will **check** Azure before/after simulating the change and allow you to 
continue forward if you are happy with them.

## New: "Template Specs"
Previously with Azure ARM templates, if you wanted to share them, you had to put them in a public endpoint - blob storage w a SAS key, 
for ex. Today, **Azure Template Specs** now allow you to privately share these:
1. Package your template and/or supporting files (Powershell, bash, etc)
2. Publish to **ARM Template Private Registry**
   - Private
   - Versioning built in
   - Deployable standalone or as part of a more complex deployment

Once published in the `ARM Template Private Registry`, you will get a `TEMPLATEID`. You can now use the `TEMPLATEID` in Azure 
CLI/bash/Powershell
   
Everything you can do today with Azure Blue prints & ARM Templates you will also be able to do in future with Azure ARM Template Specs

## Roadmap
* 2020 H2 Preview - **"Resource Lifecycle Management"** will allow you to define a collection of resources that can be managed as a single unit
* 2020 H2 Open Source -                
   - Language Revision - simplifying; removing requirement to write json. Goal is to be a transparent abstraction of Azure

## Questions
* How to validate ARM templates in any IDE? 
   - ARM Tools extenson for VS Code. It validates both template structure and also validates resource configuration against Azure schemas.

* Best practices? 
   - just announced [Azure Resource Manager Template Toolkit](https://samcogan.com/azure-resource-manager-template-tool-kit/) should be able to help here too - it doesn't validate, but covers other syntax errors and practices.
   
* Why use ARM Template Specs vs. storing in source control?
   - Our goal was to make these available where our customers want them. Making them available in Azure removes that extra step to configure/allow access to a different resource
   - Source control has to be publicly available to your team whereas Azure ARM Template Private Registry allows you to only publish sensitive items without fear of others seeing
   
* Will we be able to write ARM templates in YAML?
   - No

## Questions
* Any improvements for F# and C# related to ML?
   - I would caution you to just focus on Python and the open source packages/libraries. PyTorch, tensorflow, keras, pandas
   - Look for the ONNX runtime/framework if you want to leverage this in .NET. This allows you to leverage the models built in Python in .NET
   
* What is your day like?
   - Q&As w various community spaces
   - Writing content
   - Unknown
* When to use "build my own model" vs. "out of the box model"
   -  Use 80/20 rule
   - 80% of scenarios that you want to develop can be done w out of the box AI: understanding customer sentiment
   - 20% are build your own
   - **But** the 20% tends to represent 80% of the business value of your offering
* Does Microsoft publish any open machine learning datasets and problems? 
   -  Yes
   - Also check out [Azure Team's Medium blog](https://medium.com/microsoftazure/archive)
* Use the Spark ecosystem for your data prep. Once you have your data into ML format, go to Azure Machine Learning
   -  
* Azure ML vs. Databricks?
   -  Databricks uses Spark ecosystem
   - Azure ML is not; it's built on Python and has other goals such as Auto ML
* Where to learn more? 
   -  Go to [papersincode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/) and follow 
* What will differentiate us in the future?
   -   Our domain knowledge
* Any shortcut for identifying a model / cheat sheet / quick start?
   -  Auto ML

The most powerful GPU device for machine learning that we have today is billions of times more powerful than the Intel 8008 microprocessor that Bill Gates wrote his first commerical programming application.

**Count if a cell matches a pattern**

`=COUNTIF(A2:A15, "=Yes")`

If you see `5`, that means that 5 cells in that range have "Yes" and only "Yes"

**Count occurences of text within a cell**

`=COUNTA(A2:A9)`

If you see `5`, that means 5 of the cells in that range had "some text" in them

**Count occurences of blank cells**

`=COUNTBLANK(A2:A9)`

If you see `5`, that means 5 of the cells in that range are completely empty

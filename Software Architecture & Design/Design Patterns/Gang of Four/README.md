Gang of Four design patterns were fantastic way to group enterprise software engineering problems that almost every “project of significant complexity” faced in day to day programming. Goals are to solve recurring design problems and design flexible and reusable object-oriented software—that is, objects which are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

Three categories of design patterns:
1. Creational
1. Structural
1. Behavioral

# Creational design patterns
- **Abstract Factory** - 	Creates an instance of several families of classes
- **Builder** - Separates object construction from its representation
- **Factory Method** - Creates an instance of several derived classes
- **Prototype**	- A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- **Singleton** - A class of which only a single instance can exist

# Structural design patterns 
- Adapter	Match interfaces of different classes
- Bridge	Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
- Composite	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- **Decorator** - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Facade	A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Flyweight	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Proxy	An object representing another object

# Behavioral design patterns 

- Chain of Resp.	A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command	Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter	A way to include language elements in a program
- Iterator	Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator	Defines simplified communication between classes
- Memento	Capture and restore an object’s internal state
- Observer	A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State	Alter an object’s behavior when its state changes
- Strategy	Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor	Defines a new operation to a class without change

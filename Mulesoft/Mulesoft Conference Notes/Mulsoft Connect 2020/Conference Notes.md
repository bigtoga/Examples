## Digital imperative: moving faster than ever before
**It's business unusual for all of our customers**

Many hidden opportunities in current crisis - Things are now suddenly very different, and one key thing is that people are much more willing to try something new. 

With more WFH, no more "swivel chair IT" - where developers can turn around, ask for something, and IT delivers. Now we need more self-service software. 

**Anything that can run remotely should be ready to run remotely** - this drastically elevates the value of IT

## Key change: "Everyone, all at once"
IT cannot keep up with all the requests - used to be able to prioritize, but now every department is overwhelming IT with requests all at once.
* Find a way to provide self tools that allow people to "do more on their own" without fear of "making a mess" or "making a mistake"
* IT should focus more on enablement rather than delivery
* Need to give people sandbox
* Measure reactive work - try to limit to 20%
* Expecting 30% of workforce to still be remote
* 2021: half your estimated projects and focus more on proactive enablement projects

## Lindsey Irvine - Chief Marketing Officer
3 main themes:
1. Responsive: how do I quickly unlock data and integrate data?
   - Healthcare: virtual care
   - Retail: surge in retail orders
   - Pharma: COVID-19 testing
   - All of these are critical, and require data across the org. 
1. How can we increase speed and agility?
1. What investments do I make to set my team and business up for success and growth?

### Integration is the #1 reason new initiatives fail
1. Legacy infrastructure
1. Siloed data
1. Disconnected customer experiences
1. Inaccurate data
1. Multiple clouds
* Compliance FDPR & CCPA

* Custom code is the enemy of speed. It creates a bottleneck because only 1-2 people know it
* IT spends 80% of its time "integrating" instead of "innovating"
   - Integrating 150 apps takes a LOT of manpower, time

## Amit A. from Mars Corp
New CEO - wanted to move to cloud, have Digital Transformation. 
* We started to see huge explosions in "cloud applications"
* This was great at first but became a huge issue later
* Trying to get the various cloud applications to "talk to each other" was massive problem
* We decided on Mulesoft and decided to completely re-architect entire software architecture of
our entire org. 
* After going through that hard, long, arduous process, today we have 350+ applications across the business
and are able to launch 50-60 new apps per year

## Lindsey - Agility, Speed and Efficiency
* 60% speed improvement
* 65% increase in developer productivity
* 63% reduction in maintenance

## Anypoint Platform
Does 3 things:
1. Unlock, unify, and secure data
1. Ensure business continuity - scale to meet surge in digital demand and solve operational gaps
1. Transform to increase speed, agility

# Audience Profile
Candidates for this exam should have subject matter expertise implementing security controls
and threat protection, managing identity and access, and protecting data, applications, and
networks in cloud and hybrid environments as part of an end-to-end infrastructure.

Responsibilities for an Azure Security Engineer include maintaining the security posture,
identifying and remediating vulnerabilities by using a variety of security tools, implementing
threat protection, and responding to security incident escalations.

Azure Security Engineers often serve as part of a larger team dedicated to cloud-based
management and security or hybrid environments as part of an end-to-end infrastructure.

A candidate for this exam should be familiar with scripting and automation, should have a deep
understanding of networking and virtualization. A candidate should also have a strong
familiarity with cloud capabilities, Azure products and services, and other Microsoft products
and services.

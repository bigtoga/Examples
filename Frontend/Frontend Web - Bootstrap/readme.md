Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com

* Visualize bootstrap as 12-slot containers that you can split up anyway you want

### Structure
1. HTML and meta tags
2.          div class="container"
3.            div class="row"
4.             div class="col" (along with how many columns of the 12 flexbox model) it should take up

So you have 1 container with n rows. In each row, you 1-12 columns (the flexbox model/grid system)

Management Groups allow you to control RBAC and Azure Policy in a single point across subscriptions using inheritance. **As of June, 2020**, Management groups currently 
do not support blocking inheritance which may limit its usefullness across subscriptions that require a different support structure such as a production subscription 
versus a lab subscription.  In those cases RBAC roles should be assigned at the Subscription level.

As a result, it is recommended to use Active Directory groups mapped to the individual Azure RBAC roles. This allows for a significantly simpler management of 
Azure RBAC using tools and processes that are already familiar.

# Role of Mgmt Groups
Management groups are needed for unified policy, access management, and subscriptions.
- Management groups act as containers for subscriptions
- Policies and access management can be scoped around management groups
- Policies applied to management groups are inherited by all subscriptions, resource groups, and resources within that management group
- Azure RBAC roles have no action on the management group, but are inherited by all child resources.

Use the Azure DSC Extension - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/dsc-overview
> The primary use case for the Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension is to bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The service provides benefits that include ongoing management of the VM configuration and integration with other operational tools, such as Azure Monitoring. Using the extension to register VM's to the service provides a flexible solution that even works across Azure subscriptions.

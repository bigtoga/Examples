# Object Detection

Object detection classifies individual objects within the image, and returns the coordinates of a bounding box that indicates the object's location.
- Image Classification "classifies the entire image as a single entity" (this is a picture of a sheep)
- Object detection looks at individual pictures and classifies "the things it finds inside the picture"

# Uses of Computer Vision

Three main use cases:
1. Text extraction (OCR)
2. Image Understanding
3. Spatial Analysis

## Image Understanding
1. Image Classification - classifies whole images ("This is a picture of a ...")
2. Object Detection - classifies objects within pictures ("There is an orange, 2 apples, and a banana in this picture")
3. Image Analysis - extracts information and analytics from / about an image
4. Face detections
5. Semantic Segmentation - advanced ML technique that classifies individual pixels according to the object to which they belong ("given a satellite image of a golf course, classifies each pixel as playable or non-playable based on the existence of obstructions such as trees")

<summary>Image Classification</summary>

# Image Classification

Image classification is a machine learning based form of computer vision in which a **model is trained to categorize images based on the primary subject matter they contain**

<summary>Object Detection</summary>

# Object Detection

Object detection classifies individual objects within the image, and returns the coordinates of a bounding box that indicates the object's location.
- Image Classification "classifies the entire image as a single entity" (this is a picture of a sheep)
- Object detection looks at individual pictures and classifies "the things it finds inside the picture"

Three things you get back:
1. Bounding Box
2. Classification
3. Probability score

# Cognitive Services

[Found in four areas of Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals/4-understand-computer-vision):
1. Computer Vision
2. Custom Vision
3. Face service
4. Form Recognizer

Four things:
- Read the text in an image
- Detect objects
- Identify landmarks
- Categorize image

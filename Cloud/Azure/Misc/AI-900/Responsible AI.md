Microsoft recognizes [six principles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/4-guiding-principles):
- Fairness = *AI systems should treat everyone fairly and avoid affecting similarly situated groups of people in different ways*
- Reliability and Safety - *systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation*
- Privacy and Security - *systems must comply with privacy laws*
- Inclusiveness - *Inclusive design practices ... address potential barriers in a product environment that could unintentionally exclude people*
- Accountability - AI can give you answers, but in the end, the business makes a decision on when, how to use that answer
- Transparency - You cannot do the above unless you understand how the system arrived at an answer

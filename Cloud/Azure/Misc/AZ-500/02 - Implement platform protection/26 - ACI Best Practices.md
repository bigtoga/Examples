# Security recommendations for Azure Container Instances

## 1. Use a private registry

Containers are built from images that are stored in one or more repositories. These repositories can belong to a public registry, like Docker Hub, or to a private registry. An example of a private registry is the Docker Trusted Registry, which can be installed on-premises or in a virtual private cloud. You can also use cloud-based private container registry services, including Azure Container Registry.

A publicly available container image does not guarantee security. Container images consist of multiple software layers, and each software layer might have vulnerabilities. To help reduce the threat of attacks, you should store and retrieve images from a private registry, such as Azure Container Registry or Docker Trusted Registry. In addition to providing a managed private registry, Azure Container Registry supports service principal-based authentication through Azure Active Directory for basic authentication flows. This authentication includes role-based access for read-only (pull), write (push), and other permissions.

## 2. Monitor and scan container images continuosly

Take advantage of solutions to scan container images in a private registry and identify potential vulnerabilities. It’s important to understand the depth of threat detection that the different solutions provide.

For example, Azure Container Registry optionally integrates with Azure Security Center to automatically scan all Linux images pushed to a registry. Azure Security Center's integrated Qualys scanner detects image vulnerabilities, classifies them, and provides remediation guidance.

## 3. Protect credentials

Containers can spread across several clusters and Azure regions. So, you must secure credentials required for logins or API access, such as passwords or tokens. Ensure that only privileged users can access those containers in transit and at rest. Inventory all credential secrets, and then require developers to use emerging secrets-management tools that are designed for container platforms. Make sure that your solution includes encrypted databases, TLS encryption for secrets data in transit, and least-privilege role-based access control. Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that safeguards encryption keys and secrets (such as certificates, connection strings, and passwords) for containerized applications. Because this data is sensitive and business critical, secure access to your key vaults so that only authorized applications and users can access them.

Use vulnerability management as part of your container development lifecycle
By using effective vulnerability management throughout the container development lifecycle, you improve the odds that you identify and resolve security concerns before they become a more serious problem.

## 4. Scan for vulnerabilities

New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time, so scanning for and identifying vulnerabilities is a continuous process. Incorporate vulnerability scanning throughout the container lifecycle:

As a final check in your development pipeline, you should perform a vulnerability scan on containers before pushing the images to a public or private registry.

Continue to scan container images in the registry both to identify any flaws that were somehow missed during development and to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities that might exist in the code used in the container images. Map image vulnerabilities to running containers You need to have a means of mapping vulnerabilities identified in container images to running containers, so security issues can be mitigated or resolved.

## 5. Ensure that only approved images are used in your environment

There’s enough change and volatility in a container ecosystem without allowing unknown containers as well. Allow only approved container images. Have tools and processes in place to monitor for and prevent the use of unapproved container images.

An effective way of reducing the attack surface and preventing developers from making critical security mistakes is to control the flow of container images into your development environment. For example, you might sanction a single Linux distribution as a base image, preferably one that is lean (Alpine or CoreOS rather than Ubuntu), to minimize the surface for potential attacks.

Image signing or fingerprinting can provide a chain of custody that enables you to verify the integrity of the containers. For example, Azure Container Registry supports Docker's content trust model, which allows image publishers to sign images that are pushed to a registry, and image consumers to pull only signed images.

## 6. Enforce least privileges in runtime

The concept of least privileges is a basic security best practice that also applies to containers. When a vulnerability is exploited, it generally gives the attacker access and privileges equal to those of the compromised application or process. Ensuring that containers operate with the lowest privileges and access required to get the job done reduces your exposure to risk.

## 7. Reduce the container attack surface by removing unneeded privileges

You can also minimize the potential attack surface by removing any unused or unnecessary processes or privileges from the container runtime. Privileged containers run as root. If a malicious user or workload escapes in a privileged container, the container will then run as root on that system.

## 8. Log all container administrative user access for auditing

Maintain an accurate audit trail of administrative access to your container ecosystem, including your Kubernetes cluster, container registry, and container images. These logs might be necessary for auditing purposes and will be useful as forensic evidence after any security incident. Azure solutions include:
- Integration of Azure Kubernetes Service with Azure Security Center to monitor the security configuration of the cluster environment and generate security recommendations
- Azure Container Monitoring solution
- Resource logs for Azure Container Instances and Azure Container Registry

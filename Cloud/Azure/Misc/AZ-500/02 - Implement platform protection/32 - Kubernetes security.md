# cluster-master security

In AKS, the Kubernetes master components are part of the managed service provided by Microsoft. 
- Each AKS cluster has its own single-tenanted, dedicated Kubernetes master to provide the API Server, Scheduler, etc
- This master is managed and maintained by Microsoft.

**By default, the Kubernetes API server uses a public IP address and a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**. 
- You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes RBAC and Azure Active Directory

# Node security

AKS nodes are Azure virtual machines that you manage and maintain. 
- Linux nodes run an optimized Ubuntu distribution
- Windows Server nodes run an optimized Windows Server 2019 release
- Both use Moby as the container runtime

## Nodes - Updates, Patching

When an AKS cluster is created or scaled up, the **nodes are automatically deployed with the latest OS security updates and configurations.**

**Linux nodes** - The Azure platform automatically applies OS security patches to Linux nodes on a nightly basis. If a Linux OS security update requires a host reboot, 
that **reboot is not automatically performed**. You can manually reboot the Linux nodes, or a common approach is to use Kured, an open-source reboot daemon for Kubernetes. 
Kured runs as a DaemonSet and monitors each node for the presence of a file indicating that a reboot is required. 
Reboots are managed across the cluster using the same cordon and drain process as a cluster upgrade.

**Windows Server nodes** - *Windows Update does not automatically run* and apply the latest updates. On a regular schedule around the Windows Update release cycle and your own validation process, **you should perform an upgrade on the Windows Server node pool(s) in your AKS cluster**. This upgrade process creates nodes that run the latest Windows Server image and patches, then removes the older nodes. Nodes are deployed into a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. For troubleshooting and management purposes, **SSH is enabled by default. This SSH access is only available using the internal IP address.**

To provide storage, the nodes use Azure Managed Disks. For most VM node sizes, these are Premium disks backed by high-performance SSDs. The data stored on managed disks is automatically encrypted at rest within the Azure platform. To improve redundancy, these disks are also securely replicated within the Azure datacenter.

# Best Practices

Kubernetes environments, in AKS or elsewhere, currently aren't completely safe for hostile multi-tenant usage. **Additional security features such as Pod Security Policies or more fine-grained role-based access controls (RBAC) for nodes make exploits more difficult**. However, for true security when running hostile multi-tenant workloads, a hypervisor is the only level of security that you should trust. The security domain for Kubernetes becomes the entire cluster, not an individual node. **For these types of hostile multi-tenant workloads, you should use physically isolated cluster**

To protect your customer data as you run application workloads in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the security of your cluster is a key consideration.

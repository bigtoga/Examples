For most organizations, the security of business assets depends on the integrity of the privileged accounts that administer and manage IT systems. Cyber-attackers focus on privileged access to infrastructure systems (such as Active Directory and Azure Active Directory) to gain access to an organization’s sensitive data.

Traditional approaches that focus on securing the entrance and exit points of a network as the primary security perimeter are less effective due to the rise in the use of SaaS apps and personal devices on the Internet. The natural replacement for the network security perimeter in a complex modern enterprise is the authentication and authorization controls in an organization's identity layer.

Privileged administrative accounts are effectively in control of this new security perimeter. It's critical to protect privileged access, regardless of whether the environment is on-premises, cloud, or hybrid on-premises and cloud hosted services. Protecting administrative access against determined adversaries requires you to take a complete and thoughtful approach to isolating your organization’s systems from risks.

# Creating Managed Server Applications in Azure

# Lab Answer Key: Deploying Managed Containerized Workloads to Azure

## Before we start

1. Ensure that you are logged in to your Windows 10 lab virtual machine using the following credentials:

    - Username: **Admin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. Review Taskbar located at the bottom of your Windows 10 desktop. The Taskbar contains the icons for the common applications you will use in the labs:

    - Microsoft Edge

    - File Explorer

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    - [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)

    - Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

    - Windows PowerShell

    > **Note**: You can also find shortcuts to these applications in the **Start Menu**.

## Exercise 1: Create Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

#### Task 1: Open the Azure Portal

1. On the Taskbar, click the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the open browser window, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1. If prompted, authenticate with the user account account that has the owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.

#### Task 2: Open Cloud Shell

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is a symbol that is constructed of the combination of the *greater than* and *underscore* characters.

1. If this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** using your subscription, you will see a wizard to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. When prompted, in the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** pane, click **Bash (Linux)**.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the configuration options for **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. If so, proceed directly to the next task.

1. In the **You have no storage mounted** pane, click **Show advanced settings**, perform the following tasks:

    - Leave the **Subscription** drop-down list entry set to its default value.

    - In the **Cloud Shell region** drop-down list, select the Azure region matching or near the location where you intend to deploy resources in this lab.

    - In the **Resource group** section, ensure that the **Create new** option is selected and then, in the text box, type **AADesignLab0401-RG**.

    - In the **Storage account** section, ensure that the **Create new** option is selected and then, in the text box below, type a unique name consisting of a combination of between 3 and 24 characters and digits.

    - In the **File share** section, ensure that the **Create new** option is selected and then, in the text box below, type **cloudshell**.

    - Click the **Create storage** button.

1. Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before you proceed to the next task.

#### Task 3: Create an AKS cluster by using Cloud Shell

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press **Enter** to create a variable which value designates the name of the resource group you will use in this task:

    ```sh
    az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name aad0402-akscluster --node-count 1 --node-vm-size Standard_DS1_v2 --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

    > **Note**: If you receive an error message regarding availability of the VM size which value is represented by the `--node-vm-size` parameter, review the message and try other suggested VM sizes.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, in **PowerShell** on **Cloud Shell**  you can identify VM sizes available in your subscription in a given region by running the following command and reviewing the values in the **Restriction** column (make sure to replace the `region` placeholder with the name of the target region):

    ```pwsh
    Get-AzComputeResourceSku | where {$_.Locations -icontains "region"} | Where-Object {($_.ResourceType -ilike "virtualMachines")}
    ```

    > **Note**: The **Restriction** column will contain the value **NotAvailableForSubscription** for VM sizes that are not available in your subscription.

    > **Note**: As of 2/21/2019, VM Size **Standard_DS2_V2** was available in **westeurope**


1. Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task.

    > **Note**: This operation can take up to 10 minutes.

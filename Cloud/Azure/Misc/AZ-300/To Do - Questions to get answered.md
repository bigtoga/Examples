<details> <summary>CosmosDB</summary>


**How to add / remove items to the Cosmos DB**
- Know how this works in relation to the partition key
- pass the partitionKey along with the itemid as shown below and the delete should work.
- `await client.database(databaseId).container(containerId).item(itemBody.id, partitionKey).delete(itemBody);`

**How to query (read)**
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-query-getting-started
- SQL API works on JSON values
- Azure Cosmos DB supports strict JSON items only
- A Cosmos container is a schema-free collection of JSON items
- Step 1: create the json
```json
{
  "id": "AndersenFamily",
  "lastName": "Andersen",
  "parents": [
     { "firstName": "Thomas" },
     { "firstName": "Mary Kay"}
  ],
  "children": [
     {
         "firstName": "Henriette Thaulow",
         "gender": "female",
         "grade": 5,
         "pets": [{ "givenName": "Fluffy" }]
     }
  ],
  "address": { "state": "WA", "county": "King", "city": "Seattle" },
  "creationDate": 1431620472,
  "isRegistered": true
}
```

```sql
SELECT {"Name":f.id, "City":f.address.city} AS Family
    FROM Families f
    WHERE f.address.city = f.address.state
```    



**How does the partition key work when adding & reading data? Try different scenarios**

**How does it work with unique keys**
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/unique-keys
    - **You create a unique key *policy* when you create an Azure Cosmos container**
    - You can define unique keys only when you create an Azure Cosmos container
    - Unique key names are case-sensitive
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/partitioning-overview
    - items in a container are divided into distinct subsets called logical partitions. 
    - Logical partitions are formed based on value of the partition key
    - All items in a logical partition **have the same partition key value**

**How to move VM to new resource group**

**How to move VM to new resource group in different location**

**How to move VM to new vnet**
1. Delete the vm
2. Create a new vm
- you cannot attach a NIC from one resource group to a vm in a different rg

<details> <summary>Virtual Networks</summary>

**How to set up peering between two vnets in two different subscriptions?**
- Set up two virtual network gateways
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-peering-different-subscriptions

**If you move an unassigned public IP from one region to another with a different location, does the IP change?**
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/move-across-regions-publicip-powershell
- Step 1: Make sure that the Azure Public IP is in the Azure region from which you want to move.
    - Azure Public IPs are region specific and can't be moved from one region to another
- Step 2: Create new resource group in new supported location (within the same region)
- Step 3: Move - yes, the location changes

**When to use MPLS?**
- ExpressRoute but not required; can direct use like a site to site VPN over MPLS if needed

**Steps to set up ExpressRoute**
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager

**Move web job to new resource group in new location - does location of web job change? Location of app service plan change?**
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-limitations/app-service-move-limitations
- Requirements:
    - The destination resource group must not have any existing App Service resources
    - All App Service resources in the resource group must be moved together.
- Answer: Yes, location of both change

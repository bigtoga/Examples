# Activity Log

1. From the ANF instance, click on **Activity Log**
2. By default, Activity Log will filter on / at the resource group level. This is likely to give you too much noise. **Add a filter for Resource: <resource_name>**
3. You can then filter additionally for:
    - `Write account resource (Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/write)`

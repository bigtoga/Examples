## Monitoring
**Slow Windows VM - think it is networking**
- From the VM1 blade, install performance diagnostics and run *Advanced performance analysis*
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/performance-diagnostics
        - 

**Linux - want to monitor metrics and logs?** 
- Azure PerformanceDiagnostics extension
- You can use extensions to configure diagnostics on your VMs to collect additional metric data. The basic host metrics are available, but to see more granular and VM-specific metrics, you need to install the Azure diagnostics extension on the VM.

# Networking
- vnets across VPNs = enable Gateway Transit
- on-prem to vnet = enable Gateway Transit

Kusto:
- Stores data on a backend striped set of drives to allow parallel searching/writing
- Stores data as column store / columnar 
- Designed around a “write once, delete rarely “ model 
- Designed for ingestion speed, this there are no constraints applied during load

# Cluster architecture 

Kusto cluster is a collection of compute nodes built on top of Azure Virtual Machines. 
- The minimum cluster size is two nodes
- the maximum is about 500

### The four types of nodes

Each node can be one or more of the following roles. 

- **Admin Node** - responsible for maintaining the overall cluster metadata
- **Query Head** - responsible for accepting and processing Kusto queryies. This is what you interact with when you are in the portal, in Azure Data Explorer, or using the Query Planner
- **Data Node** - the most common role, like its name indicates, this node responsible for: (1) storing data; (2) contribute the CPU and memory when execute the Kusto query
- **Gateway Node** - responsible for processing external API calls, authentication, and request dispatches

#### Admin node
- Every cluster has one Admin node 
- The admin mode maintains the cluster metadata snapshot
- The Admin node loads the metadata snapshot from Azure blob storage to its memory and maintains it as immutable data structure
- If the current Admin node becomes unavailable, a new Admin is immediately elected. The new Admin then loads d the metadata snapshot, and also send a survey to the rest nodes to collect their runtime status

# Data Architecture 

```
Cluster
|___database1
|   |___table1
|   |   |___extent data
|   |   |   |___column0
|   |   |   |   |___data blocks
|   |   |   |   |___policy:authorization;data retention...
|   |   |   |___column1
|   |   |___schema,ordered list of fields
|   |   |___policy objects:authorization;data retention...
|   |___table2
|   |___policy objects:authorization;data retention...
|___database2
``` 

You can see a table’s extents with `.show table TableName detail`

## Indexing

Kusto uses columnstore and automatically creates and maintains indexes. If you are used to SQL Server, you have to manually and carefully create indexes for the needed columns for the best performance. In Kusto, by default, every field is indexed during the data ingestion stage, one index for one column. In the table level index, the index keys point to extent address

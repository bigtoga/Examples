Environment overview:
- IaaS environment with Windows 2016 Active Directory-based domain (WAD) `MYSITE`
- Azure AD tenant with custom vanity domain for `mysite.com`
- Azure AD Connect enabled and WAD is in sync with AAD
- Writeback enabled on AAD so that changes can be made in either 
- You have DNS servers inside your WAD

# Basics of DNS in Azure
DNS can be created/managed in multiple places:
- Public DNS
  - From Azure DNS (public)
  - From another DNS provider
  - From your own public DNS servers
- Private DNS
  - From Azure Provided Name Resolution (the default for virtual networks is to use Azure DNS)
  - From your Windows Active Directory DNS
  
# Where you configure the DNS servers for the environment
1. Set up your Windows Active Directory (private) DNS first
1. Add these servers to the virtual network's DNS Servers (Portal -> Virtual Networks -> <choose your vnet> -> DNS Servers)
2. All VMs and access requests within this vnet will now use your local DNS servers
    1. It will use the DNS servers in the order they are listed in the vnet ('priority' order)
    1. If the first DNS server (a) does not have the domain requested, and (b) there is no conditional forwarder set up, it will look up the domain in public DNS
    1. If you want to have VMs name resolution across virtual networks, you will have to set up conditional forwarders to include the correct DNS suffix
  
## Azure-provided name resolution: 
Default for virtual networks
  - Pros:
    - You can opt to not create / manage your own DNS servers
    - Azure DNS automatically scales (sort of)
    - VMs within the same vnet automatically can resolve each other's IP addresses
  - Cons:
    - Single vnet only - DNS lookup is scoped to a virtual network. DNS names created for one virtual networks can't be resolved from other virtual networks.
    - The Azure-created DNS suffix cannot be modified
    - WINS and NetBIOS not supported
    - You cannot manually register your own records
    - Host names must be DNS-compatible. Names must use only 0-9, a-z, and '-', and cannot start or end with a '-'.
    - No reverse DNS support
    - No query logging  
    - DNS query traffic is throttled for each VM. Throttling shouldn't impact most applications. If request throttling is observed, ensure that client-side caching is enabled

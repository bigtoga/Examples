# How do users get to use MFA?
Up to you. 

1. Call to phone - Places an automated voice call. The user answers the call and presses # in the phone keypad to authenticate. 
    - The phone number is not synchronized to on-premises Active Directory. 
    - A voice call to phone is important because it persists through a phone handset upgrade, allowing the user to register the mobile app on the new device

2. Text message to phone 
    - Two-way SMS means that the user must text back a particular code. Two-way SMS is deprecated and not supported after November 14, 2018. 
    - Users who are configured for two-way SMS are automatically switched to call to phone verification at that time.

3. Notification through mobile app
  - The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS. Push notifications through the mobile app provide the best user experience

4. Verification code from mobile app
    - The Microsoft Authenticator app generates a new OAUTH verification code every 30 seconds. The user enters the verification code into the sign-in interface. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS. 
    - Verification code from mobile app can be used when the phone has no data connection or cellular signal.

✔️ There is also a selection to **cache passwords** so that users do not have to authenticate on trusted devices. The number of days before a user must re-authenticate on trusted devices can also be configured 
    - Between 1 to 60 days
    - default is 14 days

# Misc
**Trusted IPs** - Allows federated users or IP address ranges to bypass 2FA
- Notice there are two selections in this screenshot. Which selections you can make depends on whether you have managed or federated tenants.
- *Managed tenants* - you can specify IP ranges that can skip MFA
- *Federated tenants* - specify IP ranges and you can also exempt AD FS claims users

✔️ The Trusted IPs bypass works only from inside of the company intranet. **If you select the All Federated Users option and a user signs in from outside the company intranet, the user must authenticate by using two-step verification. The process is the same even if the user presents an AD FS claim.**

**One-Time Bypass**

**Fraud Alerts** - Block user when fraud is reported 

- Configure the fraud alert feature so that your users can report fraudulent attempts to access their resources
- Users can report fraud attempts by using the mobile app or through their phone. 
- *Block user when fraud is reported* - If a user reports fraud, their account is blocked for 90 days or until an administrator unblocks their account. An administrator can review sign-ins by using the sign-in report and take appropriate action to prevent future fraud. An administrator can then unblock the user's account

**Account lockout**
*The account lockout settings are only applied when a pin code is entered for the MFA prompt* 

The following settings are available:
- Number of MFA denials to trigger account lockout
- Minutes until account lockout counter is reset
- Minutes until account is automatically unblocked

**Block and unblock users**
- If a user's device has been lost or stolen, you can block authentication attempts for the associated account.

- *Notifications*
Email notifications can be configured when users report fraud alerts. These notifications are typically sent to identity administrators, as the user's account credentials are likely compromised.

**OAUTH tokens**
Azure AD supports the use of OATH-TOTP SHA-1 tokens that refresh codes every 30 or 60 seconds. Customers can purchase these tokens from the vendor of their choice

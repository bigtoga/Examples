**Conditional Access policies are enforced after the first-factor authentication has been completed**

Conditional Access is not intended as an organization's first line of defense for scenarios like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks but can use signals from these events to determine access.

The old world of security behind a corporate firewall, having your secure network perimeter just doesn’t work anymore, not with people wanting to work from anywhere, being able to connect to all sorts of cloud applications.
**Conditional Access is at the heart of the new identity driven control plane.**

Conditional access policy is really a next generation policy that’s built for the cloud. It’s able to consider massive amounts of data, as well as contextual data from a user sign in flow and make sure that the right controls are enforced.

# Identity as a Service — the new control plane
  - Data plane vs. control plane
  - In a switch or router, the control plane is the part that controls where the traffic is to go, but it’s not responsible for the movement of the traffic.
  - The control plane learns the routes, either static or dynamic. The part responsible for moving the traffic is the forwarding plane.

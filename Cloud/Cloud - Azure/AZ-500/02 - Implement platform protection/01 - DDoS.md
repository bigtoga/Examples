# Tiers

Basic
- Automatically enabled as part of the Azure platform
- Always-on traffic monitoring
- real-time mitigation of common network-level attacks
- provide the same defenses utilized by Microsoft's online services
- The entire scale of Azure's global network can be used to distribute and mitigate attack traffic across regions
- IPv4 and IPv6 Azure public IP addresses

Standard
- Protection policies are tuned through dedicated traffic monitoring and machine learning algorithms
- Policies are applied to public IP addresses associated to resources deployed in virtual networks, such as Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, and Azure Service Fabric instances
- Does not apply to App Service Environments.
- Real-time telemetry is available through Azure Monitor views during an attack, and for history
- Rich attack mitigation analytics are available via diagnostic settings
- Application layer protection can be added through the Azure Application Gateway Web Application Firewall or by installing a 3rd party firewall from Azure Marketplace. 
- Protection is provided for IPv4 and IPv6 Azure public IP addresses

Mitigates:
- Volumetric attacks
    - The attack's goal is to flood the network layer with a substantial amount of seemingly legitimate traffic. It includes **UDP floods, amplification floods, and other spoofed-packet floods**. DDoS Protection Standard mitigates these potential multi-gigabyte attacks by absorbing and scrubbing them, with Azure's global network scale, automatically.
- protocol attacks
    - These attacks render a target inaccessible, by **exploiting a weakness in the layer 3 and layer 4 protocol stack. It includes, SYN flood attacks, reflection attacks, and other protocol attacks**. DDoS Protection Standard mitigates these attacks, differentiating between malicious and legitimate traffic, by interacting with the client, and blocking malicious traffic.
- Resource / App layer attacks 
    - These attacks target web application packets, to disrupt the transmission of data between hosts. The attacks include **HTTP protocol violations, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other layer 7 attacks**
    - Use a Web Application Firewall, such as the Azure Application Gateway web application firewall, as well as DDoS Protection Standard to provide defense against these attacks. There are also third-party web application firewall offerings available in the Azure Marketplace.
- Malformed packets

Within a few minutes of attack detection, you’ll be notified with Azure Monitor metrics

# Best Practices

## Best practice 1

Ensure that security is a priority throughout the entire lifecycle of an application, from design and implementation to deployment and operations. Applications might have bugs that allow a relatively low volume of requests to use a lot of resources, resulting in a service outage.

## Best practice 2 

Design your applications to scale horizontally to meet the demands of an amplified load—specifically, in the event of a DDoS. If your application depends on a single instance of a service, it creates a single point of failure. Provisioning multiple instances makes your system more resilient and more scalable

Examples:
- For Azure App Service, select an App Service plan that offers multiple instances.
- For Azure Cloud Services, configure each of your roles to use multiple instances.
- For Azure Virtual Machines, ensure that your VM architecture includes more than one VM and that each VM is included in an availability set. We recommend using virtual machine scale sets for autoscaling capabilities.

## Best practice 3

Layer security defenses in an application to reduce the chance of a successful attack. Implement security-enhanced designs for your applications by using the built-in capabilities of the Azure platform.

Examples:
- Be aware that the risk of attack increases with the size, or surface area, of the application. You can reduce the surface area by using IP allow lists to close down the exposed IP address space and listening ports that aren’t needed on the load balancers (for Azure Load Balancer and Azure Application Gateway).
- You can also use NSGs to reduce the attack surface. You can use service tags and application security groups as a natural extension of an application’s structure to minimize complexity for creating security rules and configuring network security.

## Best practice 4

Know typical traffic volumes, the connectivity model between the application and other applications, and the service endpoints that are exposed to the public internet.

# The 5 Pillars of Network Security

| Pillar  	|  Description 	|
|---	|---	|
| Scalability   	|   The ability of a system to handle increased load	|
| Availability  	| The proportion of time that a system is functional and working  	|
| Resiliency  	| The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function  	|
| Management  	|  Operations processes that keep a system running in production 	|
| Security  	|  Protecting applications and data from threats 	|

# Protecting applications and data from threats

‎Helping ensure that an application is resilient enough to handle a DoS targeted at the application itself is most important. Security and privacy features are built in to the Azure platform, beginning with the [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl). The SDL addresses security at every development phase and ensures that Azure is continually updated to make it even more secure. We will look at SDL later in this course.

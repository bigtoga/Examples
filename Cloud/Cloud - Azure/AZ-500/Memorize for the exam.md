# HDInsight & Apache

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-overview
    - [Why use HDInsight?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-overview#why-should-i-use-azure-hdinsight) - optimized clusters for Apache-based things like Hadoop, Spark, more; end to end SLA; integrates w Azure Monitor; globally available; support Python, .NET; Azure AD integrated
- [Domain join](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/domain-joined/apache-domain-joined-configure-using-azure-adds)
    - **Enterprise Security Package (ESP) clusters provide multiuser access on Azure HDInsight cluster connected to an Azure AD domain**
    - **Requires Global administrator to enable**
    - **Can required trusted IPs and MFA**
  
- **How to allow HDInsight to be available to users authenticating through on-premise?**
    - **Password Hash sync** with AD Connect is required for on-prem hybrid    
    - Configuring Azure AD DS is also required - - it is the only supported way for HDInsight to perform authentication. AD Connect from on-prem to Azure AD syncs the user identity, then Azure AD DS authenticates to HDInsights
    - Create a VPN between on-prem and Azure    
    - Create a custom DNS server in the Azure Virtual Network
    - Configure the virtual network to use the custom DNS server instead of the default Azure Recursive Resolver
    - Configure forwarding between the custom DNS server and your on-premises DNS server

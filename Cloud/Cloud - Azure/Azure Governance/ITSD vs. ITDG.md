When organizations talk about IT governance, they usually talk about IT Demand governance (ITDG) and IT Supply governance (ITSG)
- **IT demand governance (ITDG)** - what IT should work on is the process by which organizations ensure the effective evaluation, selection, prioritization, and funding of competing IT investments; oversee their implementation; and extract (measurable) business benefits. ITDG is a business investment decision-making and oversight process, and it is a business management responsibility. (Gartner n.d.)
- **IT supply-side governance (ITSG)** - how IT should do what it does is concerned with ensuring that the IT organization operates in an effective, efficient and compliant fashion, and it is primarily a CIO responsibility. (Gartner n.d.)

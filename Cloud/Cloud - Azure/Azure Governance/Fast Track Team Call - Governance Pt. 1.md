# 1. Setup Guide Overview

Uses the [Azure setup guide](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/QuickstartPlaybookBlade/guideId/intro-azure-setup)

## Resource Groups 

What belongs in a resource group? 
- Things w same lifecycle
- Things w same lock requirements
- Things you want to control permissions to on a group basis (vs. individual resource permissions)

Why do resource groups have to define a region? 
- This is where the metadata for that region is defined

## Subscriptions

Why would I have different subsriptions?
- DEV, STG, PROD, DR
- To bypass [limits of the Azure platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- To separate billing by department/app/etc

## Management Groups

Why?
- Simplifies policies and permissions mgmt

## Naming Standards

Suggest we use the Cloud Adoption Framework's naming conventions - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming

Scott: "Do you recommend that the Azure resource name matches the NetBIOS name of a VM?"
- Yes: "We've seen this make it easier to interact with teams managing or using the VMs but don't have access to Azure. This also helps when it comes down to costs as the the Azure VM name will be on your invoice."

Scott: "What about explicitly creating OS disk and NIC instead of letting Azure auto-create those?"
- "... it is common to start creating VMs through the Azure portal to get familiar with the platform. We will generally see a switch to automated deployments through scripts, ci/cd pipelines, ARM templates, etc. where there are more configuration options to control naming of additional resources. Then we'll see disk and NIC resources to be customized to your naming standards versus letting Azure pick the names instead."

## Tagging

How to apply same tag to multiple resources at once in the portal?
- Home -> All Resources -> Select the items you want -> Assign Tags

# 3. Managed Access

Recommended by the CAF: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/considerations/roles

How can I see what someone's access is to a given resource?
- Go to the resource's blade
- Access control (IAM)
- 

# 4. Manage Costs & Billing

Can we set up a hard limit? 
- No: "There is currently not a capability to set a hard limit on the spend in a subscription. Resources will have different pricing models, so some resources will incur costs when it is created but other resources are based on usage. We commonly see budgets leveraged for notifications and ensuring the sandbox teams have access to Cost Management to better view and monitor their costs within a subscription or within a specific resource group."

# 5. Plan governance, security, and compliance

# 6. Establish monitoring and reporting

# 7. Stay current with Azure

# Discrete data points
### ELI5
Discrete data can only take a small, predefined set of values. 

Discrete data involves round, concrete numbers that are determined by counting. Discrete data relates to individual, countable items.
Some synonyms for the word “discrete” include: disconnected, separate and distinct. 

`A fun rule of thumb is that, in many cases, discrete data can be preceded by “the number of.”`

Discrete data can also be qualitative. Your nationality is a discrete value. The national census is entirely composed of discrete data, both qualitative (nationality, ethnicity, et al) and quantitative (number of children living in the home, et al). 

### Examples of discrete data
* The number of customers who bought different items
* The number of computers in each department
* The number of items you buy at the grocery store each week

Each of the above, although the numbers might be measured "over time", the numbers themselves represent ** discrete ** data points that cannot be broken down further and are concrete representations. 

# Continuous data points
### ELI5
Continuous data can take on any value from a range. 

Continuous data involves complex numbers that are measured across a specific time interval. 
These numbers often need to be highly accurate and often have many decimal places. 

`A fun rule of thumb is that, if your spreadsheet has values like 2.84739, you are dealing with a continuous variable`

`Another fun rule of thumb is that, if the data was measured using a formula or machine, it's likely to be continuous data`

### Examples of continuous data
* Weight of newborn babies
* Wind speed 
* Temperature of a sensor

Although something like `Temperature of a sensor` cannot be broken down 
further, there are three clues that this is continuou Data:
1. the need for precision (89.62974 degrees)
2. the process to arrive at this number (using a machine
that measures temperature with an internal formula)
3. that, while we have a realistic range that these temperatures could fall within
(-20F to +500F for ex), a given measurement could fall anywhere within that
range. 

With continuous data, note the likelihood that a given measurement could 
literally be any one of thousands of
possible numbers (due to either a large "realistic range"
or the precision needed as expressed by many decimal 
places). 

# Quiz - Discrete or continuous?
** You record a log of how many push-ups per day you could achieve for 30 days **
Discrete because (a) you are recording a counting of things that (b) cannot be broken into smaller parts. You don't count a half a push-up - it's a discrete value that can't be broken down further.
